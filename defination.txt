## **Features to Implement**
### **User Roles**
1. **Admin**: Manage users, jobs, and platform settings.
2. **Employer**: Post and manage job listings, view applications.
3. **Job Seeker**: Search for jobs, upload resumes, and apply.

### **AI-Powered Features**
1. **Job Recommendations**: Use AI to recommend jobs based on skills and preferences.
2. **Resume Parsing**: Extract skills and qualifications from uploaded resumes to match job listings.
3. **Skill Matching**: Match job descriptions with the applicant's skills using AI algorithms.
4. **Real-Time Chat**: Enable employers and job seekers to communicate seamlessly.

### **Core Functionalities**
- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure login and signup.
- **Job Management**: CRUD operations for job listings.
- **Application Tracking**: Allow job seekers to track their applications.
- **Premium Jobs**: Payment integration for employers to post premium job listings.
- **Notifications**: Alerts for job matches, application updates, etc.
- **Dashboards**: Analytics for admins, employers, and job seekers.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **React**: Build a dynamic, responsive UI.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management.
- **RTK Query**: For efficient API integration.
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for styling.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Integrate WebSockets for real-time updates.

### **Backend**
- **Node.js & Express**: API development.
- **Mongoose**: Schema and model design for MongoDB.
- **Socket.IO**: For chat and notifications.
- **OpenAI API**: For AI-driven recommendations and resume parsing.

### **Database**
- **MongoDB Atlas**: For cloud-based database hosting.

### **Deployment**
- **Frontend**: Vercel.
- **Backend**: Render.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas.

## **Step-by-Step Plan**

### **1. Setup and Authentication**
- Initialize the MERN stack project.
- Create role-based authentication (Admin, Employer, Job Seeker).
- Use JWT for secure session management.

### **2. Job Posting and Management**
- Design a `Job` schema in MongoDB with fields like title, description, skills, salary, etc.
- Create APIs for CRUD operations on job listings.
- Add filtering and sorting options on the frontend.

### **3. Job Search and Recommendations**
- Integrate AI using OpenAI or TensorFlow.js to recommend jobs:
  - Collect user preferences (skills, location, job type).
  - Build a recommendation system based on past behavior and profile details.
- Create a search page with filters (e.g., category, salary range, location).

### **4. Resume Parsing**
- Allow job seekers to upload resumes (PDF or DOCX).
- Use AI to extract skills, experience, and qualifications.
- Match parsed data with job requirements to calculate a compatibility score.

### **5. Application System**
- Create an `Application` schema:
  - Store job reference, applicant reference, status (e.g., pending, approved).
- Enable employers to view applications and change their status.
- Add a tracking dashboard for job seekers.

### **6. Real-Time Chat**
- Use Socket.IO to implement chat functionality between employers and job seekers.

### **7. Payment Integration**
- Add a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or Razorpay) for premium job postings.
- Manage subscription plans for employers.

### **8. Notifications**
- Use WebSockets or Firebase Cloud Messaging to send real-time notifications for job updates and application statuses.

### **9. Admin Dashboard**
- Manage users, jobs, and reports.
- View analytics like job postings, applications, and user activities.

## **ER Diagram**
An ER diagram will include key entities like `User`, `Job`, `Application`, `Chat`, and their relationships:
- `User`: `{_id, name, email, password, role, profile, preferences}`
- `Job`: `{_id, title, description, skills, salary, employer_id}`
- `Application`: `{_id, job_id, user_id, status, date}`
- `Chat`: `{_id, participants, messages}`

---

## **AI Integration Ideas**
1. **Job Recommendations**: Train a recommendation model using historical job search and application data.
2. **Resume Parsing**: Use OpenAI's GPT models or custom-trained NLP models for extracting data from resumes.
3. **Skill Matching**: Use cosine similarity or other NLP techniques to match skills with job requirements.

---

## **Deployment**
- Deploy the **frontend** on Vercel.
- Deploy the **backend** on Render.
- Use **MongoDB Atlas** for the database.

What do you think, Arjun? Should we start with the basic setup, like authentication and role management?
